== Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant Flow

1. The User provides their credentials (e.g., username and password) directly to the Client Application.
2. The Client sends a token request to the Authorization Server, including the User's credentials.
3. The Authorization Server verifies the credentials and sends an access token directly to the Client.
4. The Client requests a protected resource from the Resource Server using the access token.
5. The Resource Server sends the protected resource to the Client.

The Resource Owner Password Credentials grant allows the Client Application to directly request an access token from the Authorization Server by providing the user's credentials. This grant type is typically used in trusted environments where the Client has obtained the user's credentials and can securely handle them. It should be used with caution and only when other grant types are not applicable.
