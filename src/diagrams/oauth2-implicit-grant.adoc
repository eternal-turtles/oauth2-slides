== Implicit Grant Flow

1. The User initiates the authorization process by accessing the Client Application.
2. The Client sends an authorization request to the Authorization Server.
3. The Authorization Server presents an authorization page to the User.
4. The User enters their credentials and approves the authorization request.
5. The Authorization Server sends an access token directly to the Client.
6. The Client requests a protected resource from the Resource Server using the access token.
7. The Resource Server sends the protected resource to the Client.

In the Implicit grant, the access token is issued directly to the Client in the initial response from the Authorization Server. This grant type is typically used in browser-based applications or mobile apps where the Client can securely receive the access token without the need for additional server-side communication.
