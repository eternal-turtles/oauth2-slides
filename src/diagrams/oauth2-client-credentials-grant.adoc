== Client Credentials Flow

1. The Client sends a token request to the Token Endpoint, including its client credentials.
2. The Token Endpoint validates the client credentials with the Authorization Server.
3. The Authorization Server issues an access token to the Token Endpoint.
4. The Token Endpoint sends the access token back to the Client.
5. The Client requests a protected resource from the Resource Server using the access token.
6. The Resource Server sends the protected resource to the Client.

In the Client Credentials grant, the Client authenticates directly with the Authorization Server using its client credentials, and obtains an access token. This grant type is suitable for client applications that are trusted and have their own identity, such as background jobs or server-to-server communication.
